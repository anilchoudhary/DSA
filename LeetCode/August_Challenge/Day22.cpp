An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates.
A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles.
ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom - left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top - right corner.
                           length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
                           1 <= rects.length <= 100
                           pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
                                       pick is called at most 10000 times.
                                       Example 1:
                                       Input:
                                       ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
                                       [[[[1, 1, 5, 5]]], [], [], []]
                                       Output:
                                       [null, [4, 1], [4, 1], [3, 3]]
                                       Example 2:
                                       Input:

                                       Output:
                                       [null, [-1, -2], [2, 0], [-2, -1], [3, 0], [-2, -2]]
